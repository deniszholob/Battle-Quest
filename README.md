Battle Quest Game Remake in HTML/CSS/Javascript that you can [play](https://deniszholob.github.io/Battle-Quest)!

This game was an end of the year, final project for my 11th grade highschool programming class. I originally programmed it in visual basic. The remake is not a complete game, just the basic sample of what it was.
